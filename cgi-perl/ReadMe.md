## What is this?
Ever wondered what the cgi-bin folder does on a web server?
Well, that is a mistake the previous generation did that still exist in a lot of places, not to mention embedded systems.
In short it stands for "Common Gateway Interface" and is a first attempt to create what today is known as dynamic web pages.

The interpretted Perl programming language is a default install on pretty much any UNIX-alike system that you can find and is a very portable way to execute code.

These programs are written as CGI programs and can be dropped in the cgi-bin directory of a web server and be executed from a browser that access the web server.
