## What is this?
Ever wondered what the cgi-bin folder is on a web server?
Well, that is a mistake the previous generation did that still exist.
In short it stands for "Common Gateway Configuration" and is a first attempt to create what today is known as dynamic web pages.

The interpretted Perl programming language still exist as default on pretty much any UNIX-alike system that you can find and is a portable way to execute code.

These programs are written as CGI programs and can be dropped in the cgi-bin directory and be executed from a browser that access the web server.
